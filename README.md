# cvqkd-dsp-review-tools

Toolkit for **systematic literature review (SLR)** data management under the **APISSER methodology (Phase P6 â€“ Tools & Data Management)**, tailored to the study of **Digital Signal Processing from Classical Coherent Systems to Continuous-Variable QKD**.

## âœ¨ Features
- Import screening spreadsheets (Excel/CSV) into a structured SQLite database (L-DB).
- Manage eligibility decisions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and research question mapping.
- Link and hash local PDF files for reproducibility.
- Detect and merge duplicate records (by DOI and normalized title+year).
- Generate PRISMA-ready counts and exclusion statistics.
- Export consolidated datasets and per-RQ publication lists in CSV format.
- Fully version-controlled pipeline (Python + SQLite + Bash).

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `src/` â†’ Python scripts (import, scan PDFs, dedupe, reports).
- `scripts/` â†’ Bash helpers (`setup.sh`, `run_all.sh`).
- `data/` â†’ SQLite database (`l_db.sqlite`).
- `pdfs/` â†’ folder for storing article PDFs.
- `exports/` â†’ generated CSV reports and PRISMA counts.
- `Planilha_Triagem_APISSER.xlsx` â†’ screening spreadsheet (to be provided by the user).
